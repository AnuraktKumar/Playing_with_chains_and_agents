# Playing_with_chains_and_agents
This repo contains my notebooks which I used to create different LLM applications

<ol>
<li> llama-2-pdfreader.ipynb: Reads the pdf you write the path too in pdf read cell. Needs a GPU to run on and uses Llama-2-7b-chat-hf </li> 
<li> SQL_Generation_with_FewShot.ipynb: Upload your own database in sqlite format. The notebook shows the importance of few-shot prompting and how it helps. Update the examples list with examples on your own database </li>
