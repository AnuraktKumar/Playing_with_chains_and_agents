# Playing_with_chains_and_agents
This repo contains my notebooks which I used to create different LLM applications
(1) llama-2-pdfreader.ipynb: Reads the pdf you write the path too in pdf read cell. Needs a GPU to run on and uses Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
(2) SQL query generation: Upload your own database in sqlite format. The notebook shows the importance of few-shot prompting and how it helps
